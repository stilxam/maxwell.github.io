### **Selected Projects**

**Mamba Generative Code Infilling** | *JAX, Equinox, Transformers, Orbax*
*   Architected a **~40M parameter hybrid model** fusing Bidirectional Mamba (SSM) with local Multihead Attention to fill masked JAX code sequences.
*   Engineered a data pipeline scraping **100M+ tokens** from GitHub, including custom cleaning scripts and a 50k-token Byte-Level BPE tokenizer.
*   Implemented a custom training loop with mixed-precision (fp16), dynamic loss scaling, and gradient accumulation.

**EquiNTK: Neural Tangent Kernel in JAX** | *JAX, Equinox, Jaxtyping*
*   Developed a library replacing Google’s archived `neural-tangents` to provide first-party support for Equinox models.
*   Engineered memory-efficient NTK computation and NNGP from first principles to process large datasets without OOM errors.
*   Created a predictive module using kernel regression to forecast model training trajectories.

**GOLF: Gradient-Optimized Piecewise Linear Function** | *JAX, Equinox, Optax*
*   Built a fully differentiable piecewise linear spline model allowing end-to-end gradient-based optimization of breakpoints and values.
*   Designed a custom **L1 regularization** term to automatically merge segments and engineered a curvature-based initialization for faster convergence.

**EquiMixedP: Mixed-Precision Training** | *JAX, Equinox*
*   Implemented a wrapper library to enable robust `bfloat16`/`float16` training for Equinox modules.
*   Designed a dynamic loss scaling mechanism to prevent numerical underflow/overflow, resolving JIT compilation issues found in existing libraries.
